Description:

  Place the specified ports and logic cells in the current design, or all
  ports and logic cells, onto device resources on the target part. The tool
  optimizes placement to minimize negative timing slack and reduce overall
  wire length, while also attempting to spread out placement to reduce
  routing congestion.

  Placement is one step of the complete design implementation process, which
  can be run automatically through the use of the launch_runs command when
  running the Vivado tools in Project Mode.

  In Non-Project Mode, the implementation process must be run manually with
  the individual commands: opt_design, place_design, phys_opt_design,
  power_opt_design, and route_design. Refer to the Vivado Design Suite User
  Guide: Design Flows Overview (UG892) for a complete description of Project
  Mode and Non-Project Mode.

  Both placement and routing can be completed incrementally, based on prior
  results stored in a Design Checkpoint file (DCP), using the incremental
  compilation flow. Refer to the read_checkpoint command, or to Vivado Design
  Suite User Guide: Implementation (UG904) for more information on
  incremental place and route.

  Note: The place_design can be multi-threaded to speed the process. Refer to
  the set_param command for more information on setting the
  general.maxThreads parameter.

  You can also manually place some elements of the design using place_ports,
  or by setting LOC properties on the cell, and then automatically place the
  remainder of the design using place_design.

  This command requires an open synthesized design, and it is recommended
  that you run the opt_design command prior to running place_design to avoid
  placing a suboptimal netlist.

Arguments:

  -directive <arg> - (Optional) Direct placement to achieve specific design
  objectives. Only one directive can be specified for a single place_design
  command, and values are case-sensitive. Supported values include:

   *  Explore - Increased placer effort in detail placement and
      post-placement optimization.

   *  WLDrivenBlockPlacement - Wire length-driven placement of RAM and DSP
      blocks. Override timing-driven placement by directing the Vivado placer
      to minimize the distance of connections to and from blocks.

   *  ExtraNetDelay_high - Increases estimated delay of high fanout and
      long-distance nets. Three levels of pessimism are supported: high,
      medium, and low. ExtraNetDelay_high applies the highest level of
      pessimism.

   *  ExtraNetDelay_low - Increases estimated delay of high fanout and
      long-distance nets. Three levels of pessimism are supported: high,
      medium, and low. ExtraNetDelay_low applies the lowest level of
      pessimism.

   *  AltSpreadLogic_high - (UltraScale only) Spreads logic throughout the
      device to avoid creating congested regions using algorithms created
      specifically for UltraScale target devices. Three levels are supported:
      high, medium, and low. AltSpreadLogic_high achieves the highest level
      of spreading.

   *  AltSpreadLogic_medium - (UltraScale only) Spreads logic throughout the
      device to avoid creating congested regions using algorithms created
      specifically for UltraScale target devices. Three levels are supported:
      high, medium, and low. AltSpreadLogic_medium achieves a medium level of
      spreading compared to low and high.

   *  AltSpreadLogic_low - (UltraScale only) Spreads logic throughout the
      device to avoid creating congested regions using algorithms created
      specifically for UltraScale target devices. Three levels are supported:
      high, medium, and low. AltSpreadLogic_low achieves the lowest level of
      spreading.

   *  ExtraPostPlacementOpt - Increased placer effort in post-placement
      optimization.

   *  ExtraTimingOpt - Use an alternate algorithm for timing-driven placement
      with greater effort for timing.

   *  SSI_SpreadLogic_high - Distribute logic across SLRs.
      SSI_SpreadLogic_high achieves the highest level of distribution.

   *  SSI_SpreadLogic_low - Distribute logic across SLRs. SSI_SpreadLogic_low
      achieves a minimum level of logic distribution, while reducing
      placement runtime.

   *  SSI_SpreadSLLs - Partition across SLRs and allocate extra area for
      regions of higher connectivity.

   *  SSI_BalanceSLLs - Partition across SLRs while attempting to balance
      SLLs between SLRs.

   *  SSI_BalanceSLRs - Partition across SLRs to balance number of cells
      between SLRs.

   *  SSI_HighUtilSLRs - Direct the placer to attempt to place logic closer
      together in each SLR.

   *  RuntimeOptimized - Run fewest iterations, trade higher design
      performance for faster runtime.

   *  Quick - Absolute, fastest runtime, non-timing-driven, performs the
      minimum required placement for a legal design.

   *  Default - Run place_design with default settings.

  Refer to the Vivado Design Suite User Guide: Implementation (UG904) for
  more information on placement strategies and the -directive option.

  Note: The -directive option controls the overall placement strategy, and is
  not compatible with any specific place_design options. It can only be used
  with -quiet and -verbose. In addition, the -directive option is ignored if
  the design is using the incremental compilation flow as defined by
  read_checkpoint -incremental.

  -no_timing_driven - (Optional) Disables the default timing driven placement
  algorithm. This results in a faster placement based on wire lengths, but
  ignores any timing constraints during the placement process.

  -timing_summary - (Optional) Report the post-placement worst negative slack
  (WNS) using results from static timing analysis. The WNS value is identical
  to that of report_timing_summary when run on the post-placement design. By
  default the placer reports an estimated WNS based on incremental placement
  updates during the design implementation. The -timing_summary option incurs
  additional runtime to run a full timing analysis.

  -unplace - (Optional) Unplace all the instances which are not locked by
  constraints. Cells with fixed placement (IS_LOC_FIXED set to true), are not
  affected.

  Note: Use the set_property to change IS_LOC_FIXED to FALSE prior to
  unplacing fixed cells.

  -post_place_opt - (Optional) Run optimization after placement to improve
  critical path timing at the expense of additional placement and routing
  runtime. This optimization can be run at any stage after placement. The
  optimization examines the worst case timing paths and tries to improve
  placement to reduce delay.

  Note: Any placement changes will result in unrouted connections, so
  route_design will need to be run after -post_place_opt.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example places the current design, runs optimization, routes
  the design, runs post placement optimization, and then reroutes the design
  to cleanup any unconnected nets as a result of post placement optimization:

    place_design 
    phys_opt_design 
    route_design 
    place_design -post_place_opt 
    phys_opt_design 
    route_design

  The following example directs the Vivado placer to try different placement
  algorithms to achieve a better placement result:

    place_design -directive Explore

  This example unplaces the current design:

    place_design -unplace

Description:

  Route the nets in the current design to complete logic connections on the
  target part.

  Predefined routing strategies can be quickly selected using the
  route_design -directive command, or specific route options can be
  configured to define your own routing strategy.

  Routing can be completed automatically with route_design, or can be
  completed iteratively using the various options of the route_design command
  to achieve route completion and timing closure. Iterative routing provides
  you some control over the routing process to route critical nets first and
  then route less critical nets, and to control the level of effort and the
  timing algorithms for these various route passes.

  Routing is one step of the complete design implementation process, which
  can be run automatically through the use of the launch_runs command when
  running the Vivado tools in Project Mode.

  In Non-Project Mode, the implementation process must be run manually with
  the individual commands: opt_design, place_design, phys_opt_design,
  power_opt_design, and route_design. Refer to the Vivado Design Suite User
  Guide: Design Flows Overview (UG892) for a complete description of Project
  Mode and Non-Project Mode.

  Note: The route_design can be multi-threaded to speed the process. Refer to
  the set_param command for more information on setting the
  general.maxThreads parameter.

  Both placement and routing can be completed incrementally, based on prior
  results stored in a Design Checkpoint file (DCP), using the incremental
  compilation flow. Refer to the read_checkpoint command, or to Vivado Design
  Suite User Guide: Implementation (UG904) for more information on
  incremental place and route.

  This command requires a placed design, and it is recommended that you have
  optimized the design with opt_design prior to placement.

Arguments:

  -unroute <arg> - (Optional) Unroute nets in the design. If no arguments are
  specified, all nets in the design are unrouted. The route_design command
  will not route any nets when the -unroute option is specified.

   *  Combine with the -nets option to limit unrouting to a list of nets.

   *  Combine with the -pins option to unroute from a specified pin to the
      nearest branch of the net.

   *  Combine with the -physical_nets option to unroute all logic 1 and logic
      0 nets.

  -release_memory - (Optional) Free router memory resources for subsequent
  route passes. This option does not run route passes, but only releases
  memory held by the router to reduce router initialization. The router will
  need to reload design data for subsequent route passes.

  -nets <args> - (Optional) Route or unroute only the specified net objects.
  Net objects must be specified using the get_nets command.

  Note: The router uses a quick route approach to find a routing solution for
  the specified nets, ignoring timing delays, when routing with -nets,
  -physical_nets, or -pins specified. Use -delay to find a route with the
  shortest delay.

  -physical_nets - (Optional) Route or unroute only logic zero and logic one
  nets.

  -pins <args> - (Optional) Route or unroute to the specified pins, which
  must be input pins. If a specified pin is driven by a multiple fanout net,
  only the route segment between the net and pin is affected.

  -directive <arg> - (Optional) Direct routing to achieve specific design
  objectives. Only one directive can be specified for a single route_design
  command, and values are case-sensitive. Supported values are:

   *  Explore - Causes the Vivado router to explore different critical path
      routes based on timing, after an initial route.

      Note: The -directive Explore option launches the Vivado static timing
      analyzer for the most accurate timing information, like the
      -timing_summary option.

   *  NoTimingRelaxation - Prevents the router from relaxing timing to
      complete routing. If the router has difficulty meeting timing, it will
      run longer to try to meet the original timing constraints.

   *  MoreGlobalIterations - Uses detailed timing analysis throughout all
      stages instead of just the final stages, and will run more global
      iterations even when timing improves only slightly.

   *  HigherDelayCost - Adjusts the router`s internal cost functions to
      emphasize delay over iterations, allowing a trade-off of runtime for
      better performance.

   *  AdvancedSkewModeling - Uses more accurate skew modeling throughout all
      routing stages which may improve design performance on higher-skew
      clock networks.

   *  AlternateCLBRouting - (UltraScale only) Chooses alternate routing
      algorithms that require extra runtime but may help resolve routing
      congestion.

   *  RuntimeOptimized - Run fewest iterations, trade higher design
      performance for faster runtime.

   *  Quick - Absolute fastest runtime, non-timing-driven, performs the
      minimum required routing for a legal design.

   *  Default - Run route_design with default settings.

  Refer to the Vivado Design Suite User Guide: Implementation (UG904) for
  more information on the effects of each directive.

  Note: The -directive option controls the overall routing strategy, and is
  not compatible with any specific route_design options, except -preserve and
  -tns_cleanup. It can also be used with -quiet and -verbose. In addition,
  the -directive option is ignored if the design is using the incremental
  compilation flow as defined by read_checkpoint -incremental.

  -tns_cleanup - (Optional) By default, to reduce runtime, the router focuses
  on optimizing the Worst Negative Slack (WNS) path as opposed to Total
  Negative Slack (TNS) paths. This option invokes an optional phase at the
  end of routing where the router attempts to fix the TNS paths, those
  failing paths other than the WNS path. This option may reduce TNS at the
  cost of added runtime, but will not affect WNS. The -tns_cleanup option is
  recommended when using post-route phys_opt_design to ensure that
  optimization focuses on the WNS path and does not waste effort on TNS paths
  that can be fixed by the router. This option can be used in combination
  with -directive.

  -no_timing_driven - (Optional) Disables the default timing driven routing
  algorithm. This results in faster routing results, but ignores any timing
  constraints during the routing process.

  -preserve - (Optional) Existing completed routes will be preserved and not
  subject to the rip-up and reroute phase. This does not apply to routing
  that is fixed using the IS_ROUTE_FIXED or FIXED_ROUTE properties, which is
  not subject to being rerouted. Routing is preserved only for the current
  route_design command.

  Note: Partially routed nets are subject to rerouting to complete the
  connection. If you want to preserve the routing of a partially routed net,
  you should apply the FIXED_ROUTE property to the portion of the route you
  want to preserve.

  -delay - (Optional) Can only be used in combination with the -nets or -pins
  options. By default nets are routed to achieve the fastest routing runtime,
  ignoring timing constraints, when using -nets and -pins options. The -delay
  option directs the router to try to achieve the shortest routed
  interconnect delay, but still ignores timing constraints.

  Note: You can specify multiple nets to route at the same time using the
  -delay option, but this can result in conflicts for routing resources. The
  Vivado router may create node overlap errors if the nets are in close
  proximity to each other because the -delay option will reuse routing
  resources to achieve the shortest routes for all specified nets. Therefore
  it is recommended to route nets and pins individually using the -delay
  option, beginning with the most critical.

  -auto_delay - (Optional) Can only be used in combination with the -nets or
  -pins options. It is recommended to use the -auto_delay option on a placed
  design, and limit the specified number of nets or pins to less than 100.
  The -auto_delay option directs the router to prioritize setup and hold
  critical paths using the defined timing constraints.

  -max_delay <arg> - (Optional) Can only be used with -pins. Directs the
  router to try to achieve a delay less than or equal to the specified delay
  given in picoseconds. When this options is specified, the -delay option is
  implied.

  -min_delay <arg> - (Optional) Can only be used with -pins. Directs the
  router to try to achieve a delay greater than or equal to the specified
  delay given in picoseconds. When this option is specified, the -delay
  option is implied.

  -timing_summary - (Optional) By default, the router outputs a final timing
  summary to the log, based on Vivado router internal estimated timing which
  might differ slightly from the actual routed timing due to pessimism in the
  delay estimates. The -timing_summary option forces the router to launch the
  Vivado static timing analyzer to report the timing summary based on actual
  routed delays, but incurs additional run time for the static timing
  analysis. The timing summary consists of the Worst Negative Slack (WNS),
  Total Negative Slack (TNS), Worst Hold Slack (WHS), and Total Hold Slack
  (THS). The values are identical to that of report_timing_summary when run
  on the post-route design.

  Note: The Vivado static timing analyzer is also launched by the -directive
  Explore option.

  -finalize - (Optional) When routing interactively you can specify
  route_design -finalize to complete any partially routed connections.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  Route the entire design, and direct the router to try multiple algorithms
  for improving critical path delay:

    route_design -directive Explore

  The following example routes the set of timing critical nets,
  $criticalNets, to the shortest interconnect delay, marks the nets as fixed
  using the IS_ROUTE_FIXED property, and then routes the rest of the design
  using a low effort directive for fast results:

    route_design -delay -nets $criticalNets  
    set_property IS_ROUTE_FIXED 1 $criticalNets  
    route_design -directive RuntimeOptimized

  Route the specified nets using the fastest runtime:

    route_design -nets [get_nets ctrl0/ctr*]

  Route the specified nets to get the shortest interconnect delays:

    route_design -nets [get_nets ctrl0/ctr*] -delay

  Route to the specified pins:

    route_design -pins [get_pins ctrl0/reset_reg/D ctrl0/ram0/ADDRARDADDR]

  Route to a particular pin, try to achieve less than 500 ps delay:

    route_design -pins [get_pins ctrl0/reset_reg/D] -max_delay 500

  Route to a particular pin, try to achieve more than 200 ps delay:

    route_design -pins [get_pins ctrl0/ram0/ADDRARDADDR] -min_delay 200

Description:

  Optimizes a design netlist for the target part. Optimization can provide
  improvements to synthesized netlists from third-party tools, or for
  netlists that may not have been optimized during synthesis.

  Run this command prior to implementation to optimize the design and
  simplify the netlist before placing and routing the design.

  The opt_design command performs the following optimizations by default:

   *  Retarget

   *  Constant Propagation

   *  Sweep

   *  Global Buffer (BUFG) optimizations

   *  Block RAM Power optimizations

  Note: Using command-line options for specific optimizations results in
  opt_design performing only the specified optimizations and disabling all
  others, even the ones that are usually performed by default.

  To perform LUT Remapping, you must specify -remap.

  To perform area-based re-synthesis, you must specify -resynth_area, or
  -directive ExploreArea.

  To perform sequential area-based re-synthesis, you must specify
  -resynth_seq_area , or -directive ExploreSequentialArea.

Arguments:

  -retarget - (Optional) Retarget one type of block to another when
  retargetting the design from one device family to another. For example,
  retarget instantiated MUXCY or XORCY components into a CARRY4 block; or
  retarget DCM to MMCM. The retarget optimization also absorbs inverters into
  downstream logic where possible.

  Note: The -retarget argument is optional, as are the other optimizations.
  However this optimization is run by default unless explicitly overridden by
  another optimization.

  -propconst - (Optional) Propagate constant inputs through the circuit,
  resulting in a simplified netlist. Propagation of constants can eliminate
  redundant combinational logic from the netlist.

  -sweep - (Optional) Remove unnecessary logic, removing loadless cells and
  nets.

  -bram_power_opt - (Optional) Enables power optimization on Block RAM cells.
  Changes the WRITE_MODE on unread ports of true dual-port RAMs to NO_CHANGE,
  and applies intelligent clock gating to Block RAM outputs.

  Note: Specific BRAM cells can be excluded from this optimization using the
  set_power_opt command.

  -remap - (Optional) Remap the design to combine multiple LUTs into a single
  LUT to reduce the depth of the logic.

  -resynth_area - (Optional) Perform re-synthesis in area mode to reduce the
  number of LUTs.

  -resynth_seq_area - (Optional) Perform re-synthesis to reduce both
  combinational and sequential logic. Performs a superset of the optimization
  provided by -resynth_area .

  -directive <arg> - (Optional) Direct the mode of optimization with specific
  design objectives. Only one directive can be specified for a single
  opt_design command, and values are case-sensitive. Supported values
  include:

   *  Explore - Run multiple passes of optimization to improve results.

   *  ExploreArea - Run multiple passes of optimization, with an emphasis on
      reducing area.

   *  ExploreWithRemap - Similar to ExploreArea but adds the remap
      optimization to compress logic levels.

   *  ExploreSequentialArea - Run multiple passes of optimization, with an
      emphasis on reducing registers and related combinational logic.

   *  AddRemap - Run the default optimization, and include LUT remapping to
      reduce logic levels.

   *  NoBramPowerOpt - Runs opt_design without the default BRAM power
      optimization.

   *  RuntimeOptimized - Run the fewest iterations, trading optimization
      results for faster runtime.

   *  Default - Run the default optimization.

  Refer to the Vivado Design Suite User Guide: Implementation (UG904) for
  more information on the effects of each directive.

  Note: The -directive option controls the overall optimization strategy, and
  is not compatible with any specific optimization options. It can only be
  used with -quiet and -verbose.

  -muxf_remap - (Optional) Convert MUXFs to LUT3s to potentially improve
  route-ability of the design.

  -hier_fanout_limit <arg> - (Optional) Net drivers with fanout greater than
  the specified limit (<arg>) will be replicated according to the logical
  hierarchy. For each hierarchical instance driven by the high-fanout net, if
  the fanout within the hierarchy is greater than the specified limit, then
  the net within the hierarchy is driven by a replica of the driver of the
  high-fanout net.

  -bufg_opt - (Optional) Perform various optimizations related to global
  buffers (BUFG/BUFGCE). Insert a buffer on unbuffered clock nets (fanout >
  30), insert BUFGs on high fanout nets (fanout > 25k), and perform
  load-splitting when a high-fanout net drives both combinational and
  sequential logic: the combinational portion bypasses the BUFG because the
  added delay is too large.

  Note: The phys_opt_design command can be used to optimize the combinational
  portion, while the sequential portion can be driven by BUFG.

  -control_set_merge - (Optional) Reduce the drivers of logically-equivalent
  control signals to a single driver. This is like a reverse fanout
  replication, and results in nets that are better suited for module-based
  replication.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command. This option displays detailed information
  about the logic that is affected by each optimization.

Examples:

  The following example performs all four default optimizations: retarget,
  constant propagation, sweep, and BRAM power optimization. The command
  returns detailed results with the -verbose switch:

    opt_design -verbose

  This example excludes specific BRAM cells from power optimization using the
  set_power_opt command, and then runs opt_design with the four default
  optimizations:

    
    set_power_opt -exclude_cells [get_cells \ 
       -filter {PRIMITIVE_TYPE =~ BMEM.*.*} \ 
       -of_objects [get_pins -leaf -filter {DIRECTION == IN} \ 
       -of_objects [get_nets -of_objects [get_pins clock/bufgctrl_clk_mld/O]]]] 
    opt_design

  The following example performs the sweep and retarget optimizations:

    
    opt_design -sweep -retarget

  Note: Because -sweep and -retarget are expressly enabled in the prior
  example, -propconst optimization and -bram_power_opt are implicitly
  disabled.

  The following example directs the opt_design command to use various
  algorithms to achieve potentially better results:

    opt_design -directive Explore

  The following example directs the opt_design command to use various
  algorithms to achieve potentially better results, while focusing on area
  reduction:

    opt_design -directive ExploreArea

Description:

  Place the specified ports and logic cells in the current design, or all
  ports and logic cells, onto device resources on the target part. The tool
  optimizes placement to minimize negative timing slack and reduce overall
  wire length, while also attempting to spread out placement to reduce
  routing congestion.

  Placement is one step of the complete design implementation process, which
  can be run automatically through the use of the launch_runs command when
  running the Vivado tools in Project Mode.

  In Non-Project Mode, the implementation process must be run manually with
  the individual commands: opt_design, place_design, phys_opt_design,
  power_opt_design, and route_design. Refer to the Vivado Design Suite User
  Guide: Design Flows Overview (UG892) for a complete description of Project
  Mode and Non-Project Mode.

  Both placement and routing can be completed incrementally, based on prior
  results stored in a Design Checkpoint file (DCP), using the incremental
  compilation flow. Refer to the read_checkpoint command, or to Vivado Design
  Suite User Guide: Implementation (UG904) for more information on
  incremental place and route.

  Note: The place_design can be multi-threaded to speed the process. Refer to
  the set_param command for more information on setting the
  general.maxThreads parameter.

  You can also manually place some elements of the design using place_ports,
  or by setting LOC properties on the cell, and then automatically place the
  remainder of the design using place_design.

  This command requires an open synthesized design, and it is recommended
  that you run the opt_design command prior to running place_design to avoid
  placing a suboptimal netlist.

Arguments:

  -directive <arg> - (Optional) Direct placement to achieve specific design
  objectives. Only one directive can be specified for a single place_design
  command, and values are case-sensitive. Supported values include:

   *  Explore - Increased placer effort in detail placement and
      post-placement optimization.

   *  WLDrivenBlockPlacement - Wire length-driven placement of RAM and DSP
      blocks. Override timing-driven placement by directing the Vivado placer
      to minimize the distance of connections to and from blocks.

   *  ExtraNetDelay_high - Increases estimated delay of high fanout and
      long-distance nets. Three levels of pessimism are supported: high,
      medium, and low. ExtraNetDelay_high applies the highest level of
      pessimism.

   *  ExtraNetDelay_low - Increases estimated delay of high fanout and
      long-distance nets. Three levels of pessimism are supported: high,
      medium, and low. ExtraNetDelay_low applies the lowest level of
      pessimism.

   *  AltSpreadLogic_high - (UltraScale only) Spreads logic throughout the
      device to avoid creating congested regions using algorithms created
      specifically for UltraScale target devices. Three levels are supported:
      high, medium, and low. AltSpreadLogic_high achieves the highest level
      of spreading.

   *  AltSpreadLogic_medium - (UltraScale only) Spreads logic throughout the
      device to avoid creating congested regions using algorithms created
      specifically for UltraScale target devices. Three levels are supported:
      high, medium, and low. AltSpreadLogic_medium achieves a medium level of
      spreading compared to low and high.

   *  AltSpreadLogic_low - (UltraScale only) Spreads logic throughout the
      device to avoid creating congested regions using algorithms created
      specifically for UltraScale target devices. Three levels are supported:
      high, medium, and low. AltSpreadLogic_low achieves the lowest level of
      spreading.

   *  ExtraPostPlacementOpt - Increased placer effort in post-placement
      optimization.

   *  ExtraTimingOpt - Use an alternate algorithm for timing-driven placement
      with greater effort for timing.

   *  SSI_SpreadLogic_high - Distribute logic across SLRs.
      SSI_SpreadLogic_high achieves the highest level of distribution.

   *  SSI_SpreadLogic_low - Distribute logic across SLRs. SSI_SpreadLogic_low
      achieves a minimum level of logic distribution, while reducing
      placement runtime.

   *  SSI_SpreadSLLs - Partition across SLRs and allocate extra area for
      regions of higher connectivity.

   *  SSI_BalanceSLLs - Partition across SLRs while attempting to balance
      SLLs between SLRs.

   *  SSI_BalanceSLRs - Partition across SLRs to balance number of cells
      between SLRs.

   *  SSI_HighUtilSLRs - Direct the placer to attempt to place logic closer
      together in each SLR.

   *  RuntimeOptimized - Run fewest iterations, trade higher design
      performance for faster runtime.

   *  Quick - Absolute, fastest runtime, non-timing-driven, performs the
      minimum required placement for a legal design.

   *  Default - Run place_design with default settings.

  Refer to the Vivado Design Suite User Guide: Implementation (UG904) for
  more information on placement strategies and the -directive option.

  Note: The -directive option controls the overall placement strategy, and is
  not compatible with any specific place_design options. It can only be used
  with -quiet and -verbose. In addition, the -directive option is ignored if
  the design is using the incremental compilation flow as defined by
  read_checkpoint -incremental.

  -no_timing_driven - (Optional) Disables the default timing driven placement
  algorithm. This results in a faster placement based on wire lengths, but
  ignores any timing constraints during the placement process.

  -timing_summary - (Optional) Report the post-placement worst negative slack
  (WNS) using results from static timing analysis. The WNS value is identical
  to that of report_timing_summary when run on the post-placement design. By
  default the placer reports an estimated WNS based on incremental placement
  updates during the design implementation. The -timing_summary option incurs
  additional runtime to run a full timing analysis.

  -unplace - (Optional) Unplace all the instances which are not locked by
  constraints. Cells with fixed placement (IS_LOC_FIXED set to true), are not
  affected.

  Note: Use the set_property to change IS_LOC_FIXED to FALSE prior to
  unplacing fixed cells.

  -post_place_opt - (Optional) Run optimization after placement to improve
  critical path timing at the expense of additional placement and routing
  runtime. This optimization can be run at any stage after placement. The
  optimization examines the worst case timing paths and tries to improve
  placement to reduce delay.

  Note: Any placement changes will result in unrouted connections, so
  route_design will need to be run after -post_place_opt.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example places the current design, runs optimization, routes
  the design, runs post placement optimization, and then reroutes the design
  to cleanup any unconnected nets as a result of post placement optimization:

    place_design 
    phys_opt_design 
    route_design 
    place_design -post_place_opt 
    phys_opt_design 
    route_design

  The following example directs the Vivado placer to try different placement
  algorithms to achieve a better placement result:

    place_design -directive Explore

  This example unplaces the current design:

    place_design -unplace

Description:

  Route the nets in the current design to complete logic connections on the
  target part.

  Predefined routing strategies can be quickly selected using the
  route_design -directive command, or specific route options can be
  configured to define your own routing strategy.

  Routing can be completed automatically with route_design, or can be
  completed iteratively using the various options of the route_design command
  to achieve route completion and timing closure. Iterative routing provides
  you some control over the routing process to route critical nets first and
  then route less critical nets, and to control the level of effort and the
  timing algorithms for these various route passes.

  Routing is one step of the complete design implementation process, which
  can be run automatically through the use of the launch_runs command when
  running the Vivado tools in Project Mode.

  In Non-Project Mode, the implementation process must be run manually with
  the individual commands: opt_design, place_design, phys_opt_design,
  power_opt_design, and route_design. Refer to the Vivado Design Suite User
  Guide: Design Flows Overview (UG892) for a complete description of Project
  Mode and Non-Project Mode.

  Note: The route_design can be multi-threaded to speed the process. Refer to
  the set_param command for more information on setting the
  general.maxThreads parameter.

  Both placement and routing can be completed incrementally, based on prior
  results stored in a Design Checkpoint file (DCP), using the incremental
  compilation flow. Refer to the read_checkpoint command, or to Vivado Design
  Suite User Guide: Implementation (UG904) for more information on
  incremental place and route.

  This command requires a placed design, and it is recommended that you have
  optimized the design with opt_design prior to placement.

Arguments:

  -unroute <arg> - (Optional) Unroute nets in the design. If no arguments are
  specified, all nets in the design are unrouted. The route_design command
  will not route any nets when the -unroute option is specified.

   *  Combine with the -nets option to limit unrouting to a list of nets.

   *  Combine with the -pins option to unroute from a specified pin to the
      nearest branch of the net.

   *  Combine with the -physical_nets option to unroute all logic 1 and logic
      0 nets.

  -release_memory - (Optional) Free router memory resources for subsequent
  route passes. This option does not run route passes, but only releases
  memory held by the router to reduce router initialization. The router will
  need to reload design data for subsequent route passes.

  -nets <args> - (Optional) Route or unroute only the specified net objects.
  Net objects must be specified using the get_nets command.

  Note: The router uses a quick route approach to find a routing solution for
  the specified nets, ignoring timing delays, when routing with -nets,
  -physical_nets, or -pins specified. Use -delay to find a route with the
  shortest delay.

  -physical_nets - (Optional) Route or unroute only logic zero and logic one
  nets.

  -pins <args> - (Optional) Route or unroute to the specified pins, which
  must be input pins. If a specified pin is driven by a multiple fanout net,
  only the route segment between the net and pin is affected.

  -directive <arg> - (Optional) Direct routing to achieve specific design
  objectives. Only one directive can be specified for a single route_design
  command, and values are case-sensitive. Supported values are:

   *  Explore - Causes the Vivado router to explore different critical path
      routes based on timing, after an initial route.

      Note: The -directive Explore option launches the Vivado static timing
      analyzer for the most accurate timing information, like the
      -timing_summary option.

   *  NoTimingRelaxation - Prevents the router from relaxing timing to
      complete routing. If the router has difficulty meeting timing, it will
      run longer to try to meet the original timing constraints.

   *  MoreGlobalIterations - Uses detailed timing analysis throughout all
      stages instead of just the final stages, and will run more global
      iterations even when timing improves only slightly.

   *  HigherDelayCost - Adjusts the router`s internal cost functions to
      emphasize delay over iterations, allowing a trade-off of runtime for
      better performance.

   *  AdvancedSkewModeling - Uses more accurate skew modeling throughout all
      routing stages which may improve design performance on higher-skew
      clock networks.

   *  AlternateCLBRouting - (UltraScale only) Chooses alternate routing
      algorithms that require extra runtime but may help resolve routing
      congestion.

   *  RuntimeOptimized - Run fewest iterations, trade higher design
      performance for faster runtime.

   *  Quick - Absolute fastest runtime, non-timing-driven, performs the
      minimum required routing for a legal design.

   *  Default - Run route_design with default settings.

  Refer to the Vivado Design Suite User Guide: Implementation (UG904) for
  more information on the effects of each directive.

  Note: The -directive option controls the overall routing strategy, and is
  not compatible with any specific route_design options, except -preserve and
  -tns_cleanup. It can also be used with -quiet and -verbose. In addition,
  the -directive option is ignored if the design is using the incremental
  compilation flow as defined by read_checkpoint -incremental.

  -tns_cleanup - (Optional) By default, to reduce runtime, the router focuses
  on optimizing the Worst Negative Slack (WNS) path as opposed to Total
  Negative Slack (TNS) paths. This option invokes an optional phase at the
  end of routing where the router attempts to fix the TNS paths, those
  failing paths other than the WNS path. This option may reduce TNS at the
  cost of added runtime, but will not affect WNS. The -tns_cleanup option is
  recommended when using post-route phys_opt_design to ensure that
  optimization focuses on the WNS path and does not waste effort on TNS paths
  that can be fixed by the router. This option can be used in combination
  with -directive.

  -no_timing_driven - (Optional) Disables the default timing driven routing
  algorithm. This results in faster routing results, but ignores any timing
  constraints during the routing process.

  -preserve - (Optional) Existing completed routes will be preserved and not
  subject to the rip-up and reroute phase. This does not apply to routing
  that is fixed using the IS_ROUTE_FIXED or FIXED_ROUTE properties, which is
  not subject to being rerouted. Routing is preserved only for the current
  route_design command.

  Note: Partially routed nets are subject to rerouting to complete the
  connection. If you want to preserve the routing of a partially routed net,
  you should apply the FIXED_ROUTE property to the portion of the route you
  want to preserve.

  -delay - (Optional) Can only be used in combination with the -nets or -pins
  options. By default nets are routed to achieve the fastest routing runtime,
  ignoring timing constraints, when using -nets and -pins options. The -delay
  option directs the router to try to achieve the shortest routed
  interconnect delay, but still ignores timing constraints.

  Note: You can specify multiple nets to route at the same time using the
  -delay option, but this can result in conflicts for routing resources. The
  Vivado router may create node overlap errors if the nets are in close
  proximity to each other because the -delay option will reuse routing
  resources to achieve the shortest routes for all specified nets. Therefore
  it is recommended to route nets and pins individually using the -delay
  option, beginning with the most critical.

  -auto_delay - (Optional) Can only be used in combination with the -nets or
  -pins options. It is recommended to use the -auto_delay option on a placed
  design, and limit the specified number of nets or pins to less than 100.
  The -auto_delay option directs the router to prioritize setup and hold
  critical paths using the defined timing constraints.

  -max_delay <arg> - (Optional) Can only be used with -pins. Directs the
  router to try to achieve a delay less than or equal to the specified delay
  given in picoseconds. When this options is specified, the -delay option is
  implied.

  -min_delay <arg> - (Optional) Can only be used with -pins. Directs the
  router to try to achieve a delay greater than or equal to the specified
  delay given in picoseconds. When this option is specified, the -delay
  option is implied.

  -timing_summary - (Optional) By default, the router outputs a final timing
  summary to the log, based on Vivado router internal estimated timing which
  might differ slightly from the actual routed timing due to pessimism in the
  delay estimates. The -timing_summary option forces the router to launch the
  Vivado static timing analyzer to report the timing summary based on actual
  routed delays, but incurs additional run time for the static timing
  analysis. The timing summary consists of the Worst Negative Slack (WNS),
  Total Negative Slack (TNS), Worst Hold Slack (WHS), and Total Hold Slack
  (THS). The values are identical to that of report_timing_summary when run
  on the post-route design.

  Note: The Vivado static timing analyzer is also launched by the -directive
  Explore option.

  -finalize - (Optional) When routing interactively you can specify
  route_design -finalize to complete any partially routed connections.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  Route the entire design, and direct the router to try multiple algorithms
  for improving critical path delay:

    route_design -directive Explore

  The following example routes the set of timing critical nets,
  $criticalNets, to the shortest interconnect delay, marks the nets as fixed
  using the IS_ROUTE_FIXED property, and then routes the rest of the design
  using a low effort directive for fast results:

    route_design -delay -nets $criticalNets  
    set_property IS_ROUTE_FIXED 1 $criticalNets  
    route_design -directive RuntimeOptimized

  Route the specified nets using the fastest runtime:

    route_design -nets [get_nets ctrl0/ctr*]

  Route the specified nets to get the shortest interconnect delays:

    route_design -nets [get_nets ctrl0/ctr*] -delay

  Route to the specified pins:

    route_design -pins [get_pins ctrl0/reset_reg/D ctrl0/ram0/ADDRARDADDR]

  Route to a particular pin, try to achieve less than 500 ps delay:

    route_design -pins [get_pins ctrl0/reset_reg/D] -max_delay 500

  Route to a particular pin, try to achieve more than 200 ps delay:

    route_design -pins [get_pins ctrl0/ram0/ADDRARDADDR] -min_delay 200

                                control set optimization will be performed 
                                and fewer control sets will result. To 
                                disable control set optimization completely, 
                                set to 0.

Description:

  Directly launches the Vivado synthesis engine to compile and synthesize a
  design in either Project Mode or Non-Project Mode in the Vivado Design
  Suite. Refer to the Vivado Design Suite User Guide: Design Flows Overview
  (UG892) for a complete description of Project Mode and Non-Project Mode.

  Vivado synthesis can be launched directly with the synth_design command in
  the Non-Project Mode of the Vivado Design Suite.

  Note: The synth_design can be multi-threaded to speed the process. Refer to
  the set_param command for more information on setting the
  general.maxThreads parameter.

  In Project Mode, synthesis should be launched from an existing synthesis
  run created with the create_run command. The run is launched using the
  launch_runs command, and this in turn calls synth_design for Vivado
  synthesis.

  You can also use the synth_design command to elaborate RTL source files,
  and open an elaborated design:

    
    synth_design -rtl -name rtl_1

  This command returns a transcript of the synthesis process, or returns an
  error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -name <arg> - (Optional) This is the name assigned to the synthesized
  design when it is opened by the Vivado tool after synthesis has completed.
  This name is for reference purposes, and has nothing to do with the
  top-level of the design or any logic contained within.

  -part <arg> - (Optional) The target Xilinx device to use for the design. If
  the part is not specified the default part assigned to the project will be
  used.

  -constrset <arg> - (Optional) The name of the XDC constraints to use when
  synthesizing the design. Vivado synthesis requires the use of XDC, and does
  not support UCF. The -constrset argument must refer to a constraint fileset
  that exists. It cannot be used to create a new fileset. Use the
  create_fileset command for that purpose.

  -top <arg> - (Optional) The top module of the design hierarchy.

  Note: If you use the find_top command to define the -top option, be sure to
  specify only one top if find_top returns multiple prospects. See the
  examples below.

  -include_dirs <args> - (Optional) The directories to search for Verilog
  `include files. You can specify multiple directories by creating a list to
  contain them:

    -include_dirs {C:/data/include1 C:/data/include2}

  -generic name=<value> - (Optional) The value of a VHDL generic entity, or
  of a Verilog parameter. The -generic option can be used to override the
  assigned values of parameters in the RTL design sources. However it can
  only override parameters at the top level of the design. The parameters of
  lower-level modules can only be overridden at the time of instantiation and
  not by the -generic option. The syntax for the -generic argument is
  name=<value>, specifying the name of the generic or parameter, and the
  value to be assigned. Repeat the -generic option multiple times in the
  synth_design command for each generic or parameter value to be defined:

    synth_design -generic width=32 -generic depth=512 ...

  Note: When specifying binary values for boolean or std_logic VHDL generic
  types, you must specify the value using the Verilog bit format, rather than
  standard VHDL format:

    
    0 = 1`b0 
    01010000 = 8`b01010000

  -verilog_define name<=text> - (Optional) Set values for Verilog `define,
  and `ifdef, statements. The syntax for the -verilog_define argument is
  name<=text>, specifying the name of the define directive, and the value to
  be assigned. The argument can be reused multiple times in a single
  synth_design command.

    synth_design -verilog_define name=value -verilog_define name=value ...

  -flatten_hierarchy <arg> - (Optional) Flatten the hierarchy of the design
  during LUT mapping. The valid values are:

   *  rebuilt - This will attempt to rebuild the original hierarchy of the
      RTL design after synthesis has completed. This is the default setting.

   *  full - Flatten the hierarchy of the design.

   *  none - Do not flatten the hierarchy of the design. This will preserve
      the hierarchy of the design, but will also limit the design
      optimization that can be performed by the synthesis tool.

  -gated_clock_conversion <arg> - (Optional) Convert clock gating logic to
  utilize the flop enable pins when available. This optimization can
  eliminate logic and simplify the netlist. Refer to the GATED_CLOCK property
  in the Vivado Design Suite User Guide: Synthesis (UG901) for more
  information. Valid values for this option are:

   *  off - Disables the conversion of clock gating logic during synthesis,
      regardless of the use of the GATED_CLOCK property in the RTL design.

   *  on - Converts clock gating logic based on the use of the GATED_CLOCK
      property in the RTL design.

   *  auto - lets Vivado synthesis perform gated clock conversion if either
      the GATED_CLOCK property is present in the RTL, or if the Vivado tool
      detects a gate with a valid clock constraint.

  -directive <arg> - (Optional) Direct synthesis to achieve specific design
  objectives. Only one directive can be specified for a single synth_design
  command, and values are case-sensitive. Valid values are:

   *  default - Run the default synthesis process.

   *  runtimeoptimized - Perform fewer timing optimizations and eliminate
      some RTL optimizations to reduce synthesis run time.

   *  AreaOptimized_high - Perform general area optimizations including
      AreaMapLargeShiftRegToBRAM, AreaThresholdUseDSP directives.

   *  AreaOptimized_medium - Perform general area optimizations including
      forcing ternary adder implementation, applying new thresholds for use
      of carry chain in comparators, and implementing area optimized
      multiplexers.

   *  AlternateRoutability - Algorithms to improve routability with reduced
      use of MUXFs and CARRYs.

   *  AreaMapLargeShiftRegToBRAM - Detects large shift registers and
      implements them using dedicated blocks of RAM.

   *  AreaMultThresholdDSP - Lower threshold for dedicated DSP block
      inference for packing multipliers.

   *  FewerCarryChains - Higher operand size threshold to use LUTs instead of
      the carry chain.

  -rtl - (Optional) Elaborate the HDL source files and open the RTL design.
  In designs that use out-of-context (OOC) modules, such as IP from the
  Xilinx IP catalog, the Vivado Design Suite will import synthesized design
  checkpoints (DCP) for the OOC modules in the design, and import associated
  constraint files (XDC) into the elaborated design. However, you can disable
  the default behavior using the -rtl_skip_ip and -rtl_skip_constraints
  options.

  -rtl_skip_ip - (Optional) This option requires the use of the -rtl option.
  When elaborating the RTL design, this option causes the Vivado Design Suite
  to skip loading the DCP files for OOC modules in the design, and instead
  load a stub file to treat the OOC modules as black boxes. This can
  significantly speed elaboration of the design.

  Note: An OOC synthesis run will be needed in either case to generate the
  DCP file that is loaded during elaboration, or to generate the stub file
  needed for the black box.

  -rtl_skip_constraints - (Optional) This option requires the use of the -rtl
  option. When elaborating the RTL design, this option causes the Vivado
  Design Suite to skip loading any design constraints (XDC) into the
  elaborated design. This can significantly speed elaboration of the design.

  -bufg <arg> - (Optional) Specify the maximum number of global clock buffers
  to be used on clock nets during synthesis. Specified as a value >= 1, which
  should not exceed the BUFG count on the target device. The default value is
  12.

  Note: Vivado synthesis infers up to the number of BUFGs specified,
  including those instantiated in the RTL source. For example, with the
  default setting of -bufg 12, if there are three BUFGs instantiated in the
  RTL, the tool infers up to nine more for a total of 12.

  -no_lc - (Optional) Disable the default LUT combining feature of Vivado
  synthesis.

  -fanout_limit <arg> - (Optional) Specify a target limit for the maximum net
  fanout applied during synthesis. The default value is 10,000. This option
  is applied by Vivado synthesis when the number of loads exceeds an internal
  limit, and is only a guideline for the tool, not a strict requirement. When
  strict fanout control is required for specific signals, use the MAX_FANOUT
  property instead.

  Note: -fanout_limit does not affect control signals (such as set, reset,
  clock enable). Use the MAX_FANOUT property to replicate these signals as
  needed.

  -shreg_min_size <arg> - (Optional) Specified as an integer, this is the
  minimum length for a chain of registers to be mapped onto SRL. The default
  is three.

  -mode [ default | out_of_context ] - (Optional) Out of Context mode
  specifies the synthesis of an IP module, or block module, for use in an
  out-of-context design flow. This mode turns off I/O buffer insertion for
  the module, and marks the module as OOC, to facilitate its use in the tool
  flow. The block can also be implemented for analysis purposes. Refer to the
  Vivado Design Suite User Guide: Designing with IP (UG896) or the Vivado
  Design Suite User Guide: Hierarchical Design (UG905) for more information.

  -fsm_extraction <arg> - (Optional) Finite state machine (FSM) encoding is
  automatic (auto ) in Vivado synthesis by default. This option enables state
  machine identification and specifies the type of encoding that should be
  applied. Valid values are: off, one_hot, sequential, johnson, gray, auto.
  Automatic encoding (auto ) allows the tool to choose the best encoding for
  each state machine identified. In this case, the tool may use different
  encoding styles for different FSMs in the same design.

  Note: Use -fsm_extraction off to disable finite state machine extraction in
  Vivado synthesis. This will override the FSM_ENCODING property when
  specified.

  -keep_equivalent_registers - (Optional) Works like the KEEP property to
  prevent the merging of registers during optimization.

  -resource_sharing <arg> - (Optional) Share arithmetic operators like adders
  or subtractors between different signals, rather than creating new
  operators. This can result in better area utilization when it is turned on.
  Valid values are: auto, on, off. The default is auto.

  -cascade_dsp [ auto | tree | force ] - (Optional) Specifies how to
  implement adders that add DSP block outputs. Valid values include auto,
  tree, force. The default setting is auto .

  -control_set_opt_threshold <arg> - (Optional) Threshold for synchronous
  control set optimization to decrease the number of control sets. Specifies
  how large the fanout of a control set should be before it starts using it
  as a control set. For example, if -control_set_opt_threshold is set to 10,
  a synchronous reset that only fans out to 5 registers would be moved to the
  D input logic, rather than using the reset line of a register. However, if
  -control_set_opt_threshold is set to 4, then the reset line is used. This
  option can be specified as "auto", or as an integer from 0 to 16. The
  default setting is "auto", and the actual threshold used under "auto" can
  vary depending on the selected device architecture.

  -max_bram <arg> - (Optional) Specify the maximum number of Block RAM to add
  to the design during synthesis. Specify a value> = 1, which should not
  exceed the available BRAM count on the target device. If a value of -1 is
  used, the Vivado synthesis tool will not exceed the available Block RAM
  limit of the device. The default value is -1.

  Note: A value of 0 directs Vivado synthesis to not infer BRAMs in the
  design, but is not a recommended value.

  -max_uram <arg> - (Optional) Specify the maximum number of Ultra RAM blocks
  (URAM) to add to the design during synthesis. Specify a value >= 1, which
  should not exceed the available URAM count on the target device. If a value
  of -1 is used, the Vivado synthesis tool will not exceed the available URAM
  block limit of the device. The default value is -1.

  Note: A value of 0 directs Vivado synthesis to not infer URAM in the
  design, but is not a recommended value.

  -max_dsp <arg> - (Optional) Specify the maximum number of DSPs to add to
  the design during synthesis. Specify a value >= 1, which should not exceed
  the available DSP count on the target device. If a value of -1 is used, the
  Vivado synthesis tool will not exceed the available limit of the device.
  The default value is -1.

  Note: A value of 0 directs Vivado synthesis to not infer DSPs in the
  design, but is not a recommended value.

  -max_bram_cascade_height <arg> - (Optional) Controls the maximum number of
  BRAM that can be cascaded by the tool. A value of -1 lets Vivado synthesis
  choose up to the maximum number allowed for the target part. The default
  value is -1.

  -max_uram_cascade_height <arg> - (Optional) Controls the maximum number of
  URAM that can be cascaded by the tool. A value of -1 lets Vivado synthesis
  choose up to the maximum number allowed for the target part. The default
  value is -1.

  -retiming - (Optional) Seeks to improve circuit performance for intra-clock
  sequential paths by automatically moving registers (register balancing)
  across combinatorial gates or LUTs. It maintains the original behavior and
  latency of the circuit and does not require changes to the RTL sources.

  -no_srlextract - (Optional) Prevents the extraction of shift registers so
  that they get implemented as simple registers.

  -assert - (Optional) Enable VHDL assert statements to be evaluated. A
  severity level of failure will stop the synthesis flow and produce an
  error.

  -no_timing_driven - (Optional) Disables the default timing driven synthesis
  algorithm. This results in a reduced synthesis runtime, but ignores the
  effect of timing on synthesis.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example uses the set_property command to define the target
  part for the active project, then elaborates the source files and opens an
  RTL design:

    set_property part xc7vx485tffg1158-1 [current_project] 
    synth_design -rtl -name rtl_1

  Note: The default source set, constraint set, and part will be used in this
  example.

  The following example uses the find_top command to define the top of the
  current design for synthesis:

    
    synth_design -top [lindex [find_top] 0]

  Note: Since find_top returns multiple possible candidates, choosing index 0
  chooses the best top candidate for synthesis.

  The following example runs synthesis on the current design, defining the
  top module and the target part, and specifying no flattening of the
  hierarchy. The results of the synthesis run are then opened in a netlist
  design:

    synth_design -top top -part xc7k70tfbg676-2 -flatten_hierarchy none 
    open_run synth_1 -name netlist_1

These constraints will be ignored for synthesis but will be used in implementation. Impacted constraints are listed in the file [.Xil/DARC_DCT_Design_wrapper_propImpl.xdc].
Resolution: To avoid this warning, move constraints listed in [.Xil/DARC_DCT_Design_wrapper_propImpl.xdc] to another XDC file and exclude this new file from synthesis with the used_in_synthesis property (File Properties dialog in GUI) and re-run elaboration/synthesis.

Description:

  Place the specified ports and logic cells in the current design, or all
  ports and logic cells, onto device resources on the target part. The tool
  optimizes placement to minimize negative timing slack and reduce overall
  wire length, while also attempting to spread out placement to reduce
  routing congestion.

  Placement is one step of the complete design implementation process, which
  can be run automatically through the use of the launch_runs command when
  running the Vivado tools in Project Mode.

  In Non-Project Mode, the implementation process must be run manually with
  the individual commands: opt_design, place_design, phys_opt_design,
  power_opt_design, and route_design. Refer to the Vivado Design Suite User
  Guide: Design Flows Overview (UG892) for a complete description of Project
  Mode and Non-Project Mode.

  Both placement and routing can be completed incrementally, based on prior
  results stored in a Design Checkpoint file (DCP), using the incremental
  compilation flow. Refer to the read_checkpoint command, or to Vivado Design
  Suite User Guide: Implementation (UG904) for more information on
  incremental place and route.

  Note: The place_design can be multi-threaded to speed the process. Refer to
  the set_param command for more information on setting the
  general.maxThreads parameter.

  You can also manually place some elements of the design using place_ports,
  or by setting LOC properties on the cell, and then automatically place the
  remainder of the design using place_design.

  This command requires an open synthesized design, and it is recommended
  that you run the opt_design command prior to running place_design to avoid
  placing a suboptimal netlist.

Arguments:

  -directive <arg> - (Optional) Direct placement to achieve specific design
  objectives. Only one directive can be specified for a single place_design
  command, and values are case-sensitive. Supported values include:

   *  Explore - Increased placer effort in detail placement and
      post-placement optimization.

   *  WLDrivenBlockPlacement - Wire length-driven placement of RAM and DSP
      blocks. Override timing-driven placement by directing the Vivado placer
      to minimize the distance of connections to and from blocks.

   *  ExtraNetDelay_high - Increases estimated delay of high fanout and
      long-distance nets. Three levels of pessimism are supported: high,
      medium, and low. ExtraNetDelay_high applies the highest level of
      pessimism.

   *  ExtraNetDelay_low - Increases estimated delay of high fanout and
      long-distance nets. Three levels of pessimism are supported: high,
      medium, and low. ExtraNetDelay_low applies the lowest level of
      pessimism.

   *  AltSpreadLogic_high - (UltraScale only) Spreads logic throughout the
      device to avoid creating congested regions using algorithms created
      specifically for UltraScale target devices. Three levels are supported:
      high, medium, and low. AltSpreadLogic_high achieves the highest level
      of spreading.

   *  AltSpreadLogic_medium - (UltraScale only) Spreads logic throughout the
      device to avoid creating congested regions using algorithms created
      specifically for UltraScale target devices. Three levels are supported:
      high, medium, and low. AltSpreadLogic_medium achieves a medium level of
      spreading compared to low and high.

   *  AltSpreadLogic_low - (UltraScale only) Spreads logic throughout the
      device to avoid creating congested regions using algorithms created
      specifically for UltraScale target devices. Three levels are supported:
      high, medium, and low. AltSpreadLogic_low achieves the lowest level of
      spreading.

   *  ExtraPostPlacementOpt - Increased placer effort in post-placement
      optimization.

   *  ExtraTimingOpt - Use an alternate algorithm for timing-driven placement
      with greater effort for timing.

   *  SSI_SpreadLogic_high - Distribute logic across SLRs.
      SSI_SpreadLogic_high achieves the highest level of distribution.

   *  SSI_SpreadLogic_low - Distribute logic across SLRs. SSI_SpreadLogic_low
      achieves a minimum level of logic distribution, while reducing
      placement runtime.

   *  SSI_SpreadSLLs - Partition across SLRs and allocate extra area for
      regions of higher connectivity.

   *  SSI_BalanceSLLs - Partition across SLRs while attempting to balance
      SLLs between SLRs.

   *  SSI_BalanceSLRs - Partition across SLRs to balance number of cells
      between SLRs.

   *  SSI_HighUtilSLRs - Direct the placer to attempt to place logic closer
      together in each SLR.

   *  RuntimeOptimized - Run fewest iterations, trade higher design
      performance for faster runtime.

   *  Quick - Absolute, fastest runtime, non-timing-driven, performs the
      minimum required placement for a legal design.

   *  Default - Run place_design with default settings.

  Refer to the Vivado Design Suite User Guide: Implementation (UG904) for
  more information on placement strategies and the -directive option.

  Note: The -directive option controls the overall placement strategy, and is
  not compatible with any specific place_design options. It can only be used
  with -quiet and -verbose. In addition, the -directive option is ignored if
  the design is using the incremental compilation flow as defined by
  read_checkpoint -incremental.

  -no_timing_driven - (Optional) Disables the default timing driven placement
  algorithm. This results in a faster placement based on wire lengths, but
  ignores any timing constraints during the placement process.

  -timing_summary - (Optional) Report the post-placement worst negative slack
  (WNS) using results from static timing analysis. The WNS value is identical
  to that of report_timing_summary when run on the post-placement design. By
  default the placer reports an estimated WNS based on incremental placement
  updates during the design implementation. The -timing_summary option incurs
  additional runtime to run a full timing analysis.

  -unplace - (Optional) Unplace all the instances which are not locked by
  constraints. Cells with fixed placement (IS_LOC_FIXED set to true), are not
  affected.

  Note: Use the set_property to change IS_LOC_FIXED to FALSE prior to
  unplacing fixed cells.

  -post_place_opt - (Optional) Run optimization after placement to improve
  critical path timing at the expense of additional placement and routing
  runtime. This optimization can be run at any stage after placement. The
  optimization examines the worst case timing paths and tries to improve
  placement to reduce delay.

  Note: Any placement changes will result in unrouted connections, so
  route_design will need to be run after -post_place_opt.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example places the current design, runs optimization, routes
  the design, runs post placement optimization, and then reroutes the design
  to cleanup any unconnected nets as a result of post placement optimization:

    place_design 
    phys_opt_design 
    route_design 
    place_design -post_place_opt 
    phys_opt_design 
    route_design

  The following example directs the Vivado placer to try different placement
  algorithms to achieve a better placement result:

    place_design -directive Explore

  This example unplaces the current design:

    place_design -unplace

Description:

  Route the nets in the current design to complete logic connections on the
  target part.

  Predefined routing strategies can be quickly selected using the
  route_design -directive command, or specific route options can be
  configured to define your own routing strategy.

  Routing can be completed automatically with route_design, or can be
  completed iteratively using the various options of the route_design command
  to achieve route completion and timing closure. Iterative routing provides
  you some control over the routing process to route critical nets first and
  then route less critical nets, and to control the level of effort and the
  timing algorithms for these various route passes.

  Routing is one step of the complete design implementation process, which
  can be run automatically through the use of the launch_runs command when
  running the Vivado tools in Project Mode.

  In Non-Project Mode, the implementation process must be run manually with
  the individual commands: opt_design, place_design, phys_opt_design,
  power_opt_design, and route_design. Refer to the Vivado Design Suite User
  Guide: Design Flows Overview (UG892) for a complete description of Project
  Mode and Non-Project Mode.

  Note: The route_design can be multi-threaded to speed the process. Refer to
  the set_param command for more information on setting the
  general.maxThreads parameter.

  Both placement and routing can be completed incrementally, based on prior
  results stored in a Design Checkpoint file (DCP), using the incremental
  compilation flow. Refer to the read_checkpoint command, or to Vivado Design
  Suite User Guide: Implementation (UG904) for more information on
  incremental place and route.

  This command requires a placed design, and it is recommended that you have
  optimized the design with opt_design prior to placement.

Arguments:

  -unroute <arg> - (Optional) Unroute nets in the design. If no arguments are
  specified, all nets in the design are unrouted. The route_design command
  will not route any nets when the -unroute option is specified.

   *  Combine with the -nets option to limit unrouting to a list of nets.

   *  Combine with the -pins option to unroute from a specified pin to the
      nearest branch of the net.

   *  Combine with the -physical_nets option to unroute all logic 1 and logic
      0 nets.

  -release_memory - (Optional) Free router memory resources for subsequent
  route passes. This option does not run route passes, but only releases
  memory held by the router to reduce router initialization. The router will
  need to reload design data for subsequent route passes.

  -nets <args> - (Optional) Route or unroute only the specified net objects.
  Net objects must be specified using the get_nets command.

  Note: The router uses a quick route approach to find a routing solution for
  the specified nets, ignoring timing delays, when routing with -nets,
  -physical_nets, or -pins specified. Use -delay to find a route with the
  shortest delay.

  -physical_nets - (Optional) Route or unroute only logic zero and logic one
  nets.

  -pins <args> - (Optional) Route or unroute to the specified pins, which
  must be input pins. If a specified pin is driven by a multiple fanout net,
  only the route segment between the net and pin is affected.

  -directive <arg> - (Optional) Direct routing to achieve specific design
  objectives. Only one directive can be specified for a single route_design
  command, and values are case-sensitive. Supported values are:

   *  Explore - Causes the Vivado router to explore different critical path
      routes based on timing, after an initial route.

      Note: The -directive Explore option launches the Vivado static timing
      analyzer for the most accurate timing information, like the
      -timing_summary option.

   *  NoTimingRelaxation - Prevents the router from relaxing timing to
      complete routing. If the router has difficulty meeting timing, it will
      run longer to try to meet the original timing constraints.

   *  MoreGlobalIterations - Uses detailed timing analysis throughout all
      stages instead of just the final stages, and will run more global
      iterations even when timing improves only slightly.

   *  HigherDelayCost - Adjusts the router`s internal cost functions to
      emphasize delay over iterations, allowing a trade-off of runtime for
      better performance.

   *  AdvancedSkewModeling - Uses more accurate skew modeling throughout all
      routing stages which may improve design performance on higher-skew
      clock networks.

   *  AlternateCLBRouting - (UltraScale only) Chooses alternate routing
      algorithms that require extra runtime but may help resolve routing
      congestion.

   *  RuntimeOptimized - Run fewest iterations, trade higher design
      performance for faster runtime.

   *  Quick - Absolute fastest runtime, non-timing-driven, performs the
      minimum required routing for a legal design.

   *  Default - Run route_design with default settings.

  Refer to the Vivado Design Suite User Guide: Implementation (UG904) for
  more information on the effects of each directive.

  Note: The -directive option controls the overall routing strategy, and is
  not compatible with any specific route_design options, except -preserve and
  -tns_cleanup. It can also be used with -quiet and -verbose. In addition,
  the -directive option is ignored if the design is using the incremental
  compilation flow as defined by read_checkpoint -incremental.

  -tns_cleanup - (Optional) By default, to reduce runtime, the router focuses
  on optimizing the Worst Negative Slack (WNS) path as opposed to Total
  Negative Slack (TNS) paths. This option invokes an optional phase at the
  end of routing where the router attempts to fix the TNS paths, those
  failing paths other than the WNS path. This option may reduce TNS at the
  cost of added runtime, but will not affect WNS. The -tns_cleanup option is
  recommended when using post-route phys_opt_design to ensure that
  optimization focuses on the WNS path and does not waste effort on TNS paths
  that can be fixed by the router. This option can be used in combination
  with -directive.

  -no_timing_driven - (Optional) Disables the default timing driven routing
  algorithm. This results in faster routing results, but ignores any timing
  constraints during the routing process.

  -preserve - (Optional) Existing completed routes will be preserved and not
  subject to the rip-up and reroute phase. This does not apply to routing
  that is fixed using the IS_ROUTE_FIXED or FIXED_ROUTE properties, which is
  not subject to being rerouted. Routing is preserved only for the current
  route_design command.

  Note: Partially routed nets are subject to rerouting to complete the
  connection. If you want to preserve the routing of a partially routed net,
  you should apply the FIXED_ROUTE property to the portion of the route you
  want to preserve.

  -delay - (Optional) Can only be used in combination with the -nets or -pins
  options. By default nets are routed to achieve the fastest routing runtime,
  ignoring timing constraints, when using -nets and -pins options. The -delay
  option directs the router to try to achieve the shortest routed
  interconnect delay, but still ignores timing constraints.

  Note: You can specify multiple nets to route at the same time using the
  -delay option, but this can result in conflicts for routing resources. The
  Vivado router may create node overlap errors if the nets are in close
  proximity to each other because the -delay option will reuse routing
  resources to achieve the shortest routes for all specified nets. Therefore
  it is recommended to route nets and pins individually using the -delay
  option, beginning with the most critical.

  -auto_delay - (Optional) Can only be used in combination with the -nets or
  -pins options. It is recommended to use the -auto_delay option on a placed
  design, and limit the specified number of nets or pins to less than 100.
  The -auto_delay option directs the router to prioritize setup and hold
  critical paths using the defined timing constraints.

  -max_delay <arg> - (Optional) Can only be used with -pins. Directs the
  router to try to achieve a delay less than or equal to the specified delay
  given in picoseconds. When this options is specified, the -delay option is
  implied.

  -min_delay <arg> - (Optional) Can only be used with -pins. Directs the
  router to try to achieve a delay greater than or equal to the specified
  delay given in picoseconds. When this option is specified, the -delay
  option is implied.

  -timing_summary - (Optional) By default, the router outputs a final timing
  summary to the log, based on Vivado router internal estimated timing which
  might differ slightly from the actual routed timing due to pessimism in the
  delay estimates. The -timing_summary option forces the router to launch the
  Vivado static timing analyzer to report the timing summary based on actual
  routed delays, but incurs additional run time for the static timing
  analysis. The timing summary consists of the Worst Negative Slack (WNS),
  Total Negative Slack (TNS), Worst Hold Slack (WHS), and Total Hold Slack
  (THS). The values are identical to that of report_timing_summary when run
  on the post-route design.

  Note: The Vivado static timing analyzer is also launched by the -directive
  Explore option.

  -finalize - (Optional) When routing interactively you can specify
  route_design -finalize to complete any partially routed connections.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  Route the entire design, and direct the router to try multiple algorithms
  for improving critical path delay:

    route_design -directive Explore

  The following example routes the set of timing critical nets,
  $criticalNets, to the shortest interconnect delay, marks the nets as fixed
  using the IS_ROUTE_FIXED property, and then routes the rest of the design
  using a low effort directive for fast results:

    route_design -delay -nets $criticalNets  
    set_property IS_ROUTE_FIXED 1 $criticalNets  
    route_design -directive RuntimeOptimized

  Route the specified nets using the fastest runtime:

    route_design -nets [get_nets ctrl0/ctr*]

  Route the specified nets to get the shortest interconnect delays:

    route_design -nets [get_nets ctrl0/ctr*] -delay

  Route to the specified pins:

    route_design -pins [get_pins ctrl0/reset_reg/D ctrl0/ram0/ADDRARDADDR]

  Route to a particular pin, try to achieve less than 500 ps delay:

    route_design -pins [get_pins ctrl0/reset_reg/D] -max_delay 500

  Route to a particular pin, try to achieve more than 200 ps delay:

    route_design -pins [get_pins ctrl0/ram0/ADDRARDADDR] -min_delay 200

                       refer to Arguments section of this help for values for
                       this option.

Description:

  Place the specified ports and logic cells in the current design, or all
  ports and logic cells, onto device resources on the target part. The tool
  optimizes placement to minimize negative timing slack and reduce overall
  wire length, while also attempting to spread out placement to reduce
  routing congestion.

  Placement is one step of the complete design implementation process, which
  can be run automatically through the use of the launch_runs command when
  running the Vivado tools in Project Mode.

  In Non-Project Mode, the implementation process must be run manually with
  the individual commands: opt_design, place_design, phys_opt_design,
  power_opt_design, and route_design. Refer to the Vivado Design Suite User
  Guide: Design Flows Overview (UG892) for a complete description of Project
  Mode and Non-Project Mode.

  Both placement and routing can be completed incrementally, based on prior
  results stored in a Design Checkpoint file (DCP), using the incremental
  compilation flow. Refer to the read_checkpoint command, or to Vivado Design
  Suite User Guide: Implementation (UG904) for more information on
  incremental place and route.

  Note: The place_design can be multi-threaded to speed the process. Refer to
  the set_param command for more information on setting the
  general.maxThreads parameter.

  You can also manually place some elements of the design using place_ports,
  or by setting LOC properties on the cell, and then automatically place the
  remainder of the design using place_design.

  This command requires an open synthesized design, and it is recommended
  that you run the opt_design command prior to running place_design to avoid
  placing a suboptimal netlist.

Arguments:

  -directive <arg> - (Optional) Direct placement to achieve specific design
  objectives. Only one directive can be specified for a single place_design
  command, and values are case-sensitive. Supported values include:

   *  Explore - Increased placer effort in detail placement and
      post-placement optimization.

   *  WLDrivenBlockPlacement - Wire length-driven placement of RAM and DSP
      blocks. Override timing-driven placement by directing the Vivado placer
      to minimize the distance of connections to and from blocks.

   *  ExtraNetDelay_high - Increases estimated delay of high fanout and
      long-distance nets. Three levels of pessimism are supported: high,
      medium, and low. ExtraNetDelay_high applies the highest level of
      pessimism.

   *  ExtraNetDelay_low - Increases estimated delay of high fanout and
      long-distance nets. Three levels of pessimism are supported: high,
      medium, and low. ExtraNetDelay_low applies the lowest level of
      pessimism.

   *  AltSpreadLogic_high - (UltraScale only) Spreads logic throughout the
      device to avoid creating congested regions using algorithms created
      specifically for UltraScale target devices. Three levels are supported:
      high, medium, and low. AltSpreadLogic_high achieves the highest level
      of spreading.

   *  AltSpreadLogic_medium - (UltraScale only) Spreads logic throughout the
      device to avoid creating congested regions using algorithms created
      specifically for UltraScale target devices. Three levels are supported:
      high, medium, and low. AltSpreadLogic_medium achieves a medium level of
      spreading compared to low and high.

   *  AltSpreadLogic_low - (UltraScale only) Spreads logic throughout the
      device to avoid creating congested regions using algorithms created
      specifically for UltraScale target devices. Three levels are supported:
      high, medium, and low. AltSpreadLogic_low achieves the lowest level of
      spreading.

   *  ExtraPostPlacementOpt - Increased placer effort in post-placement
      optimization.

   *  ExtraTimingOpt - Use an alternate algorithm for timing-driven placement
      with greater effort for timing.

   *  SSI_SpreadLogic_high - Distribute logic across SLRs.
      SSI_SpreadLogic_high achieves the highest level of distribution.

   *  SSI_SpreadLogic_low - Distribute logic across SLRs. SSI_SpreadLogic_low
      achieves a minimum level of logic distribution, while reducing
      placement runtime.

   *  SSI_SpreadSLLs - Partition across SLRs and allocate extra area for
      regions of higher connectivity.

   *  SSI_BalanceSLLs - Partition across SLRs while attempting to balance
      SLLs between SLRs.

   *  SSI_BalanceSLRs - Partition across SLRs to balance number of cells
      between SLRs.

   *  SSI_HighUtilSLRs - Direct the placer to attempt to place logic closer
      together in each SLR.

   *  RuntimeOptimized - Run fewest iterations, trade higher design
      performance for faster runtime.

   *  Quick - Absolute, fastest runtime, non-timing-driven, performs the
      minimum required placement for a legal design.

   *  Default - Run place_design with default settings.

  Refer to the Vivado Design Suite User Guide: Implementation (UG904) for
  more information on placement strategies and the -directive option.

  Note: The -directive option controls the overall placement strategy, and is
  not compatible with any specific place_design options. It can only be used
  with -quiet and -verbose. In addition, the -directive option is ignored if
  the design is using the incremental compilation flow as defined by
  read_checkpoint -incremental.

  -no_timing_driven - (Optional) Disables the default timing driven placement
  algorithm. This results in a faster placement based on wire lengths, but
  ignores any timing constraints during the placement process.

  -timing_summary - (Optional) Report the post-placement worst negative slack
  (WNS) using results from static timing analysis. The WNS value is identical
  to that of report_timing_summary when run on the post-placement design. By
  default the placer reports an estimated WNS based on incremental placement
  updates during the design implementation. The -timing_summary option incurs
  additional runtime to run a full timing analysis.

  -unplace - (Optional) Unplace all the instances which are not locked by
  constraints. Cells with fixed placement (IS_LOC_FIXED set to true), are not
  affected.

  Note: Use the set_property to change IS_LOC_FIXED to FALSE prior to
  unplacing fixed cells.

  -post_place_opt - (Optional) Run optimization after placement to improve
  critical path timing at the expense of additional placement and routing
  runtime. This optimization can be run at any stage after placement. The
  optimization examines the worst case timing paths and tries to improve
  placement to reduce delay.

  Note: Any placement changes will result in unrouted connections, so
  route_design will need to be run after -post_place_opt.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example places the current design, runs optimization, routes
  the design, runs post placement optimization, and then reroutes the design
  to cleanup any unconnected nets as a result of post placement optimization:

    place_design 
    phys_opt_design 
    route_design 
    place_design -post_place_opt 
    phys_opt_design 
    route_design

  The following example directs the Vivado placer to try different placement
  algorithms to achieve a better placement result:

    place_design -directive Explore

  This example unplaces the current design:

    place_design -unplace

Categories: 
Tools

Description:

  Optimizes a design netlist for the target part. Optimization can provide
  improvements to synthesized netlists from third-party tools, or for
  netlists that may not have been optimized during synthesis.

  Run this command prior to implementation to optimize the design and
  simplify the netlist before placing and routing the design.

  The opt_design command performs the following optimizations by default:

   *  Retarget

   *  Constant Propagation

   *  Sweep

   *  Global Buffer (BUFG) optimizations

   *  Block RAM Power optimizations

  Note: Using command-line options for specific optimizations results in
  opt_design performing only the specified optimizations and disabling all
  others, even the ones that are usually performed by default.

  To perform LUT Remapping, you must specify -remap.

  To perform area-based re-synthesis, you must specify -resynth_area, or
  -directive ExploreArea.

  To perform sequential area-based re-synthesis, you must specify
  -resynth_seq_area , or -directive ExploreSequentialArea.

Arguments:

  -retarget - (Optional) Retarget one type of block to another when
  retargetting the design from one device family to another. For example,
  retarget instantiated MUXCY or XORCY components into a CARRY4 block; or
  retarget DCM to MMCM. The retarget optimization also absorbs inverters into
  downstream logic where possible.

  Note: The -retarget argument is optional, as are the other optimizations.
  However this optimization is run by default unless explicitly overridden by
  another optimization.

  -propconst - (Optional) Propagate constant inputs through the circuit,
  resulting in a simplified netlist. Propagation of constants can eliminate
  redundant combinational logic from the netlist.

  -sweep - (Optional) Remove unnecessary logic, removing loadless cells and
  nets.

  -bram_power_opt - (Optional) Enables power optimization on Block RAM cells.
  Changes the WRITE_MODE on unread ports of true dual-port RAMs to NO_CHANGE,
  and applies intelligent clock gating to Block RAM outputs.

  Note: Specific BRAM cells can be excluded from this optimization using the
  set_power_opt command.

  -remap - (Optional) Remap the design to combine multiple LUTs into a single
  LUT to reduce the depth of the logic.

  -resynth_area - (Optional) Perform re-synthesis in area mode to reduce the
  number of LUTs.

  -resynth_seq_area - (Optional) Perform re-synthesis to reduce both
  combinational and sequential logic. Performs a superset of the optimization
  provided by -resynth_area .

  -directive <arg> - (Optional) Direct the mode of optimization with specific
  design objectives. Only one directive can be specified for a single
  opt_design command, and values are case-sensitive. Supported values
  include:

   *  Explore - Run multiple passes of optimization to improve results.

   *  ExploreArea - Run multiple passes of optimization, with an emphasis on
      reducing area.

   *  ExploreWithRemap - Similar to ExploreArea but adds the remap
      optimization to compress logic levels.

   *  ExploreSequentialArea - Run multiple passes of optimization, with an
      emphasis on reducing registers and related combinational logic.

   *  AddRemap - Run the default optimization, and include LUT remapping to
      reduce logic levels.

   *  NoBramPowerOpt - Runs opt_design without the default BRAM power
      optimization.

   *  RuntimeOptimized - Run the fewest iterations, trading optimization
      results for faster runtime.

   *  Default - Run the default optimization.

  Refer to the Vivado Design Suite User Guide: Implementation (UG904) for
  more information on the effects of each directive.

  Note: The -directive option controls the overall optimization strategy, and
  is not compatible with any specific optimization options. It can only be
  used with -quiet and -verbose.

  -muxf_remap - (Optional) Convert MUXFs to LUT3s to potentially improve
  route-ability of the design.

  -hier_fanout_limit <arg> - (Optional) Net drivers with fanout greater than
  the specified limit (<arg>) will be replicated according to the logical
  hierarchy. For each hierarchical instance driven by the high-fanout net, if
  the fanout within the hierarchy is greater than the specified limit, then
  the net within the hierarchy is driven by a replica of the driver of the
  high-fanout net.

  -bufg_opt - (Optional) Perform various optimizations related to global
  buffers (BUFG/BUFGCE). Insert a buffer on unbuffered clock nets (fanout >
  30), insert BUFGs on high fanout nets (fanout > 25k), and perform
  load-splitting when a high-fanout net drives both combinational and
  sequential logic: the combinational portion bypasses the BUFG because the
  added delay is too large.

  Note: The phys_opt_design command can be used to optimize the combinational
  portion, while the sequential portion can be driven by BUFG.

  -control_set_merge - (Optional) Reduce the drivers of logically-equivalent
  control signals to a single driver. This is like a reverse fanout
  replication, and results in nets that are better suited for module-based
  replication.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command. This option displays detailed information
  about the logic that is affected by each optimization.

Examples:

  The following example performs all four default optimizations: retarget,
  constant propagation, sweep, and BRAM power optimization. The command
  returns detailed results with the -verbose switch:

    opt_design -verbose

  This example excludes specific BRAM cells from power optimization using the
  set_power_opt command, and then runs opt_design with the four default
  optimizations:

    
    set_power_opt -exclude_cells [get_cells \ 
       -filter {PRIMITIVE_TYPE =~ BMEM.*.*} \ 
       -of_objects [get_pins -leaf -filter {DIRECTION == IN} \ 
       -of_objects [get_nets -of_objects [get_pins clock/bufgctrl_clk_mld/O]]]] 
    opt_design

  The following example performs the sweep and retarget optimizations:

    
    opt_design -sweep -retarget

  Note: Because -sweep and -retarget are expressly enabled in the prior
  example, -propconst optimization and -bram_power_opt are implicitly
  disabled.

  The following example directs the opt_design command to use various
  algorithms to achieve potentially better results:

    opt_design -directive Explore

  The following example directs the opt_design command to use various
  algorithms to achieve potentially better results, while focusing on area
  reduction:

    opt_design -directive ExploreArea

Description:

  Place the specified ports and logic cells in the current design, or all
  ports and logic cells, onto device resources on the target part. The tool
  optimizes placement to minimize negative timing slack and reduce overall
  wire length, while also attempting to spread out placement to reduce
  routing congestion.

  Placement is one step of the complete design implementation process, which
  can be run automatically through the use of the launch_runs command when
  running the Vivado tools in Project Mode.

  In Non-Project Mode, the implementation process must be run manually with
  the individual commands: opt_design, place_design, phys_opt_design,
  power_opt_design, and route_design. Refer to the Vivado Design Suite User
  Guide: Design Flows Overview (UG892) for a complete description of Project
  Mode and Non-Project Mode.

  Both placement and routing can be completed incrementally, based on prior
  results stored in a Design Checkpoint file (DCP), using the incremental
  compilation flow. Refer to the read_checkpoint command, or to Vivado Design
  Suite User Guide: Implementation (UG904) for more information on
  incremental place and route.

  Note: The place_design can be multi-threaded to speed the process. Refer to
  the set_param command for more information on setting the
  general.maxThreads parameter.

  You can also manually place some elements of the design using place_ports,
  or by setting LOC properties on the cell, and then automatically place the
  remainder of the design using place_design.

  This command requires an open synthesized design, and it is recommended
  that you run the opt_design command prior to running place_design to avoid
  placing a suboptimal netlist.

Arguments:

  -directive <arg> - (Optional) Direct placement to achieve specific design
  objectives. Only one directive can be specified for a single place_design
  command, and values are case-sensitive. Supported values include:

   *  Explore - Increased placer effort in detail placement and
      post-placement optimization.

   *  WLDrivenBlockPlacement - Wire length-driven placement of RAM and DSP
      blocks. Override timing-driven placement by directing the Vivado placer
      to minimize the distance of connections to and from blocks.

   *  ExtraNetDelay_high - Increases estimated delay of high fanout and
      long-distance nets. Three levels of pessimism are supported: high,
      medium, and low. ExtraNetDelay_high applies the highest level of
      pessimism.

   *  ExtraNetDelay_low - Increases estimated delay of high fanout and
      long-distance nets. Three levels of pessimism are supported: high,
      medium, and low. ExtraNetDelay_low applies the lowest level of
      pessimism.

   *  AltSpreadLogic_high - (UltraScale only) Spreads logic throughout the
      device to avoid creating congested regions using algorithms created
      specifically for UltraScale target devices. Three levels are supported:
      high, medium, and low. AltSpreadLogic_high achieves the highest level
      of spreading.

   *  AltSpreadLogic_medium - (UltraScale only) Spreads logic throughout the
      device to avoid creating congested regions using algorithms created
      specifically for UltraScale target devices. Three levels are supported:
      high, medium, and low. AltSpreadLogic_medium achieves a medium level of
      spreading compared to low and high.

   *  AltSpreadLogic_low - (UltraScale only) Spreads logic throughout the
      device to avoid creating congested regions using algorithms created
      specifically for UltraScale target devices. Three levels are supported:
      high, medium, and low. AltSpreadLogic_low achieves the lowest level of
      spreading.

   *  ExtraPostPlacementOpt - Increased placer effort in post-placement
      optimization.

   *  ExtraTimingOpt - Use an alternate algorithm for timing-driven placement
      with greater effort for timing.

   *  SSI_SpreadLogic_high - Distribute logic across SLRs.
      SSI_SpreadLogic_high achieves the highest level of distribution.

   *  SSI_SpreadLogic_low - Distribute logic across SLRs. SSI_SpreadLogic_low
      achieves a minimum level of logic distribution, while reducing
      placement runtime.

   *  SSI_SpreadSLLs - Partition across SLRs and allocate extra area for
      regions of higher connectivity.

   *  SSI_BalanceSLLs - Partition across SLRs while attempting to balance
      SLLs between SLRs.

   *  SSI_BalanceSLRs - Partition across SLRs to balance number of cells
      between SLRs.

   *  SSI_HighUtilSLRs - Direct the placer to attempt to place logic closer
      together in each SLR.

   *  RuntimeOptimized - Run fewest iterations, trade higher design
      performance for faster runtime.

   *  Quick - Absolute, fastest runtime, non-timing-driven, performs the
      minimum required placement for a legal design.

   *  Default - Run place_design with default settings.

  Refer to the Vivado Design Suite User Guide: Implementation (UG904) for
  more information on placement strategies and the -directive option.

  Note: The -directive option controls the overall placement strategy, and is
  not compatible with any specific place_design options. It can only be used
  with -quiet and -verbose. In addition, the -directive option is ignored if
  the design is using the incremental compilation flow as defined by
  read_checkpoint -incremental.

  -no_timing_driven - (Optional) Disables the default timing driven placement
  algorithm. This results in a faster placement based on wire lengths, but
  ignores any timing constraints during the placement process.

  -timing_summary - (Optional) Report the post-placement worst negative slack
  (WNS) using results from static timing analysis. The WNS value is identical
  to that of report_timing_summary when run on the post-placement design. By
  default the placer reports an estimated WNS based on incremental placement
  updates during the design implementation. The -timing_summary option incurs
  additional runtime to run a full timing analysis.

  -unplace - (Optional) Unplace all the instances which are not locked by
  constraints. Cells with fixed placement (IS_LOC_FIXED set to true), are not
  affected.

  Note: Use the set_property to change IS_LOC_FIXED to FALSE prior to
  unplacing fixed cells.

  -post_place_opt - (Optional) Run optimization after placement to improve
  critical path timing at the expense of additional placement and routing
  runtime. This optimization can be run at any stage after placement. The
  optimization examines the worst case timing paths and tries to improve
  placement to reduce delay.

  Note: Any placement changes will result in unrouted connections, so
  route_design will need to be run after -post_place_opt.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example places the current design, runs optimization, routes
  the design, runs post placement optimization, and then reroutes the design
  to cleanup any unconnected nets as a result of post placement optimization:

    place_design 
    phys_opt_design 
    route_design 
    place_design -post_place_opt 
    phys_opt_design 
    route_design

  The following example directs the Vivado placer to try different placement
  algorithms to achieve a better placement result:

    place_design -directive Explore

  This example unplaces the current design:

    place_design -unplace

Description:

  Route the nets in the current design to complete logic connections on the
  target part.

  Predefined routing strategies can be quickly selected using the
  route_design -directive command, or specific route options can be
  configured to define your own routing strategy.

  Routing can be completed automatically with route_design, or can be
  completed iteratively using the various options of the route_design command
  to achieve route completion and timing closure. Iterative routing provides
  you some control over the routing process to route critical nets first and
  then route less critical nets, and to control the level of effort and the
  timing algorithms for these various route passes.

  Routing is one step of the complete design implementation process, which
  can be run automatically through the use of the launch_runs command when
  running the Vivado tools in Project Mode.

  In Non-Project Mode, the implementation process must be run manually with
  the individual commands: opt_design, place_design, phys_opt_design,
  power_opt_design, and route_design. Refer to the Vivado Design Suite User
  Guide: Design Flows Overview (UG892) for a complete description of Project
  Mode and Non-Project Mode.

  Note: The route_design can be multi-threaded to speed the process. Refer to
  the set_param command for more information on setting the
  general.maxThreads parameter.

  Both placement and routing can be completed incrementally, based on prior
  results stored in a Design Checkpoint file (DCP), using the incremental
  compilation flow. Refer to the read_checkpoint command, or to Vivado Design
  Suite User Guide: Implementation (UG904) for more information on
  incremental place and route.

  This command requires a placed design, and it is recommended that you have
  optimized the design with opt_design prior to placement.

Arguments:

  -unroute <arg> - (Optional) Unroute nets in the design. If no arguments are
  specified, all nets in the design are unrouted. The route_design command
  will not route any nets when the -unroute option is specified.

   *  Combine with the -nets option to limit unrouting to a list of nets.

   *  Combine with the -pins option to unroute from a specified pin to the
      nearest branch of the net.

   *  Combine with the -physical_nets option to unroute all logic 1 and logic
      0 nets.

  -release_memory - (Optional) Free router memory resources for subsequent
  route passes. This option does not run route passes, but only releases
  memory held by the router to reduce router initialization. The router will
  need to reload design data for subsequent route passes.

  -nets <args> - (Optional) Route or unroute only the specified net objects.
  Net objects must be specified using the get_nets command.

  Note: The router uses a quick route approach to find a routing solution for
  the specified nets, ignoring timing delays, when routing with -nets,
  -physical_nets, or -pins specified. Use -delay to find a route with the
  shortest delay.

  -physical_nets - (Optional) Route or unroute only logic zero and logic one
  nets.

  -pins <args> - (Optional) Route or unroute to the specified pins, which
  must be input pins. If a specified pin is driven by a multiple fanout net,
  only the route segment between the net and pin is affected.

  -directive <arg> - (Optional) Direct routing to achieve specific design
  objectives. Only one directive can be specified for a single route_design
  command, and values are case-sensitive. Supported values are:

   *  Explore - Causes the Vivado router to explore different critical path
      routes based on timing, after an initial route.

      Note: The -directive Explore option launches the Vivado static timing
      analyzer for the most accurate timing information, like the
      -timing_summary option.

   *  NoTimingRelaxation - Prevents the router from relaxing timing to
      complete routing. If the router has difficulty meeting timing, it will
      run longer to try to meet the original timing constraints.

   *  MoreGlobalIterations - Uses detailed timing analysis throughout all
      stages instead of just the final stages, and will run more global
      iterations even when timing improves only slightly.

   *  HigherDelayCost - Adjusts the router`s internal cost functions to
      emphasize delay over iterations, allowing a trade-off of runtime for
      better performance.

   *  AdvancedSkewModeling - Uses more accurate skew modeling throughout all
      routing stages which may improve design performance on higher-skew
      clock networks.

   *  AlternateCLBRouting - (UltraScale only) Chooses alternate routing
      algorithms that require extra runtime but may help resolve routing
      congestion.

   *  RuntimeOptimized - Run fewest iterations, trade higher design
      performance for faster runtime.

   *  Quick - Absolute fastest runtime, non-timing-driven, performs the
      minimum required routing for a legal design.

   *  Default - Run route_design with default settings.

  Refer to the Vivado Design Suite User Guide: Implementation (UG904) for
  more information on the effects of each directive.

  Note: The -directive option controls the overall routing strategy, and is
  not compatible with any specific route_design options, except -preserve and
  -tns_cleanup. It can also be used with -quiet and -verbose. In addition,
  the -directive option is ignored if the design is using the incremental
  compilation flow as defined by read_checkpoint -incremental.

  -tns_cleanup - (Optional) By default, to reduce runtime, the router focuses
  on optimizing the Worst Negative Slack (WNS) path as opposed to Total
  Negative Slack (TNS) paths. This option invokes an optional phase at the
  end of routing where the router attempts to fix the TNS paths, those
  failing paths other than the WNS path. This option may reduce TNS at the
  cost of added runtime, but will not affect WNS. The -tns_cleanup option is
  recommended when using post-route phys_opt_design to ensure that
  optimization focuses on the WNS path and does not waste effort on TNS paths
  that can be fixed by the router. This option can be used in combination
  with -directive.

  -no_timing_driven - (Optional) Disables the default timing driven routing
  algorithm. This results in faster routing results, but ignores any timing
  constraints during the routing process.

  -preserve - (Optional) Existing completed routes will be preserved and not
  subject to the rip-up and reroute phase. This does not apply to routing
  that is fixed using the IS_ROUTE_FIXED or FIXED_ROUTE properties, which is
  not subject to being rerouted. Routing is preserved only for the current
  route_design command.

  Note: Partially routed nets are subject to rerouting to complete the
  connection. If you want to preserve the routing of a partially routed net,
  you should apply the FIXED_ROUTE property to the portion of the route you
  want to preserve.

  -delay - (Optional) Can only be used in combination with the -nets or -pins
  options. By default nets are routed to achieve the fastest routing runtime,
  ignoring timing constraints, when using -nets and -pins options. The -delay
  option directs the router to try to achieve the shortest routed
  interconnect delay, but still ignores timing constraints.

  Note: You can specify multiple nets to route at the same time using the
  -delay option, but this can result in conflicts for routing resources. The
  Vivado router may create node overlap errors if the nets are in close
  proximity to each other because the -delay option will reuse routing
  resources to achieve the shortest routes for all specified nets. Therefore
  it is recommended to route nets and pins individually using the -delay
  option, beginning with the most critical.

  -auto_delay - (Optional) Can only be used in combination with the -nets or
  -pins options. It is recommended to use the -auto_delay option on a placed
  design, and limit the specified number of nets or pins to less than 100.
  The -auto_delay option directs the router to prioritize setup and hold
  critical paths using the defined timing constraints.

  -max_delay <arg> - (Optional) Can only be used with -pins. Directs the
  router to try to achieve a delay less than or equal to the specified delay
  given in picoseconds. When this options is specified, the -delay option is
  implied.

  -min_delay <arg> - (Optional) Can only be used with -pins. Directs the
  router to try to achieve a delay greater than or equal to the specified
  delay given in picoseconds. When this option is specified, the -delay
  option is implied.

  -timing_summary - (Optional) By default, the router outputs a final timing
  summary to the log, based on Vivado router internal estimated timing which
  might differ slightly from the actual routed timing due to pessimism in the
  delay estimates. The -timing_summary option forces the router to launch the
  Vivado static timing analyzer to report the timing summary based on actual
  routed delays, but incurs additional run time for the static timing
  analysis. The timing summary consists of the Worst Negative Slack (WNS),
  Total Negative Slack (TNS), Worst Hold Slack (WHS), and Total Hold Slack
  (THS). The values are identical to that of report_timing_summary when run
  on the post-route design.

  Note: The Vivado static timing analyzer is also launched by the -directive
  Explore option.

  -finalize - (Optional) When routing interactively you can specify
  route_design -finalize to complete any partially routed connections.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  Route the entire design, and direct the router to try multiple algorithms
  for improving critical path delay:

    route_design -directive Explore

  The following example routes the set of timing critical nets,
  $criticalNets, to the shortest interconnect delay, marks the nets as fixed
  using the IS_ROUTE_FIXED property, and then routes the rest of the design
  using a low effort directive for fast results:

    route_design -delay -nets $criticalNets  
    set_property IS_ROUTE_FIXED 1 $criticalNets  
    route_design -directive RuntimeOptimized

  Route the specified nets using the fastest runtime:

    route_design -nets [get_nets ctrl0/ctr*]

  Route the specified nets to get the shortest interconnect delays:

    route_design -nets [get_nets ctrl0/ctr*] -delay

  Route to the specified pins:

    route_design -pins [get_pins ctrl0/reset_reg/D ctrl0/ram0/ADDRARDADDR]

  Route to a particular pin, try to achieve less than 500 ps delay:

    route_design -pins [get_pins ctrl0/reset_reg/D] -max_delay 500

  Route to a particular pin, try to achieve more than 200 ps delay:

    route_design -pins [get_pins ctrl0/ram0/ADDRARDADDR] -min_delay 200
