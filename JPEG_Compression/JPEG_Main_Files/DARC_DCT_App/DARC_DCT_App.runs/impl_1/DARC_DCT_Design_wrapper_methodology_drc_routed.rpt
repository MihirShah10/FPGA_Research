2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.050 ns between DARC_DCT_Design_i/DARC_DCT_0/inst/DARC_DCT_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/dct0/INST_fsm/FSM_sequential_B01_streg_reg[1]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and DARC_DCT_Design_i/DARC_DCT_0/inst/DARC_DCT_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/dct0/INST_dat/RG_86_reg[9]/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.062 ns between DARC_DCT_Design_i/DARC_DCT_0/inst/DARC_DCT_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/dct0/INST_fsm/FSM_sequential_B01_streg_reg[5]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and DARC_DCT_Design_i/DARC_DCT_0/inst/DARC_DCT_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/dct0/INST_dat/RG_86_reg[8]/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.120 ns between DARC_DCT_Design_i/DARC_DCT_0/inst/DARC_DCT_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/dct0/INST_fsm/FSM_sequential_B01_streg_reg[1]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and DARC_DCT_Design_i/DARC_DCT_0/inst/DARC_DCT_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/dct0/INST_dat/RG_74_reg[11]/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#4 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.144 ns between DARC_DCT_Design_i/DARC_DCT_0/inst/DARC_DCT_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/dct0/INST_fsm/FSM_sequential_B01_streg_reg[1]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and DARC_DCT_Design_i/DARC_DCT_0/inst/DARC_DCT_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/dct0/INST_dat/RG_74_reg[9]/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0).
