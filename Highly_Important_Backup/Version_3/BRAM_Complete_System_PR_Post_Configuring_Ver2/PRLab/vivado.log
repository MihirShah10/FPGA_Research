ERROR: [Common 17-163] Missing value for option 'value', please type 'set_property -help' for usage info.

set_property

Description: 
Set property on object(s)

Syntax: 
set_property  [-dict <args>] [-quiet] [-verbose] <name> <value> <objects>...

Usage: 
  Name        Description
  -----------------------
  [-dict]     list of name/value pairs of properties to set
  [-quiet]    Ignore command errors
  [-verbose]  Suspend message limits during command execution
  <name>      Name of property to set. Not valid with -dict option
  <value>     Value of property to set. Not valid with -dict option
  <objects>   Objects to set properties on

Categories: 
Object, PropertyAndParameter, XDC

Description:

  Assigns the defined property <name> and <value> to the specified <objects>.

  This command can be used to define any property on an object in the design.
  Each object has a set of predefined properties that have expected values,
  or a range of values. The set_property command can be used to define the
  values for these properties. To determine the defined set of properties on
  an object, use report_property, list_property, or list_property_values .

  You can also define custom properties for an object, by specifying a unique
  <name> and <value> pair for the object. If an object has custom properties,
  these will also be reported by the report_property and list_property
  commands.

  This command returns nothing if successful, and an error if it fails.

  Note: You can use the get_property command to validate any properties that
  have been set on an object.

Arguments:

  -dict - (Optional) Use this option to specify a dictionary of multiple
  properties (<name> <value> pairs) on an object with a single set_property
  command. Multiple <name> <value> pairs must be enclosed in braces, {}, or
  quotes, "".

    -dict "name1 value1 name2 value2 ... nameN valueN"

  Note: When writing the constraints for a design using either
  save_constraints, save_constraints_as , or write_xdc, the properties
  specified using the -dict option will be written as separate set_property
  commands for each name/value pair. If you don`t want the XDC constraints to
  be expanded in this manner, you can either use the Tcl script driven
  approach in a non-project design, or use a Tcl script as a design source in
  your constraint set. Refer to Vivado Design Suite User Guide: Design Flows
  Overview (UG892) for more information on non-project based design, or refer
  to Vivado Design Suite User Guide: Using Constraints (UG903) for more
  information on using Tcl scripts in constraint sets.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <name> - (Required) Specifies the name of the property to be assigned to
  the object or objects. The <name> argument is case sensitive and should be
  specified appropriately.

  <value> - (Required) Specifies the value to assign to the <name> on the
  specified object or objects. The value is checked against the property type
  to ensure that the value is valid. If the value is not appropriate for the
  property an error will be returned.

  Note: In some cases the value of a property may include special characters,
  such as the dash character (`-`), which can cause the tool to interpret the
  value as a new argument to the command. In this case, you must use the
  explicit arguments (-name, -value, -objects) instead of the implied
  positional arguments (name, value, objects) as described here. This is
  shown in the Examples section below.

  <objects> - (Required) One or more objects to assign the property to.

Examples:

  Create a user-defined boolean property, TRUTH, for cell objects, and set
  the property on a cell:

    create_property -type bool truth cell 
    set_property truth false [lindex [get_cells] 1]

  Use the -dict option to specify multiple properties at one time on the
  current design:

    set_property -dict "POST_CRC enable POST_CRC_ACTION correct_and_continue" \ 
    [current_design]

  The following example sets the TOP property of the current fileset to
  define the top module of the project:

    set_property top fftTop [current_fileset] 
    set_property top_file {C:/Data/sources/fftTop.v} [current_fileset]

  Note: Defining the top module requires the TOP property to be set to the
  desired hierarchical block in the source fileset of the current project. In
  the preceding example TOP is the property name, fftTop is the value, and
  current_fileset is the object. In addition, the TOP_FILE property should be
  defined to point to the data source for the top module.

  This example shows how to set a property value that includes the dash
  character, `-`. The dash can cause the tool to interpret the value as a new
  command argument, rather than part of the value being specified, and will
  cause an error as shown. In this case, you must use the explicit form of
  the positional arguments in the set_property command:

    
    set_property {XELAB.MORE_OPTIONS} {-pulse_e_style ondetect} \ 
       [get_filesets sim_1] 
    ERROR: [Common 17-170] Unknown option `-pulse_e_style ondetect`,  
     please type `set_property -help` for usage info. 
    set_property -name {XELAB.MORE_OPTIONS} -value {-pulse_e_style ondetect}\ 
       -objects [get_filesets sim_1]

  The following example sets the internal VREF property value for the
  specified IO Bank:

    set_property internal_vref {0.75} [get_iobanks 0]

  The following example defines a DCI Cascade by setting the DCI_CASCADE
  property for the specified IO Bank:

    set_property DCI_CASCADE {14} [get_iobanks 0 ]

  The following example configures the synth_1 run, setting options for
  Vivado Synthesis 2013, and then launches the synthesis run:

    set_property flow {Vivado Synthesis 2016} \ 
       [get_runs synth_1] 
    set_property STEPS.SYNTH_DESIGN.ARGS.FANOUT_LIMIT 500 \ 
       [get_runs synth_1] 
    set_property STEPS.SYNTH_DESIGN.ARGS.GATED_CLOCK_CONVERSION on \ 
       [get_runs synth_1] 
    set_property STEPS.SYNTH_DESIGN.ARGS.FSM_EXTRACTION one_hot \ 
       [get_runs synth_1] 
    launch_runs synth_1

  This example is the same as the prior example, except that it uses the
  -dict option to set all the properties on the synthesis run in a single
  set_property command:

    set_property -dict [ list flow {Vivado Synthesis 2016} \ 
       STEPS.SYNTH_DESIGN.ARGS.FANOUT_LIMIT 500 \ 
       STEPS.SYNTH_DESIGN.ARGS.GATED_CLOCK_CONVERSION on \ 
       STEPS.SYNTH_DESIGN.ARGS.FSM_EXTRACTION \ 
       one_hot ] [get_runs synth_1] 
    launch_runs synth_1
